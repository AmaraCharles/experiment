  <p>Many wealthy clients who have an estate plan have not adequately protected their assets from the claims of potential creditors. A self-settled spendthrift trust commonly referred to as a domestic asset protection trust (APT), may be an appropriate creditor protection solution for clients in high-risk professions such as doctors, attorneys, architects, engineers, developers, and other small business owners.Only a handful of states have enacted laws allowing the creation of APTs, an irrevocable trust in which the grantor is also a permissible beneficiary, a “self-settled” trust. Nevada’s absence of exception creditors, no state income tax, and two-year statute of limitations period make it the most desirable state in which to establish an APT.When an APT is established in Nevada, the assets placed into the trust are protected from all creditor claims after<b> two years</b><span>. </span>Many other states have legislated certain exceptions to the protection afforded by the trust, for example, claims from ex-spouses for alimony, child support, and other specific claims. Nevada has <b>no exception creditors</b> so, after the two-year waiting period, no future creditor can pierce the trust.Nevada’s law affords an additional layer of creditor protection when limited liability companies (LLCs) and limited partnerships (LPs) established in Nevada are utilized. The “charging order” is an exclusive remedy for a creditor against a Nevada LLC or LP, including single-member entities, meaning a creditor cannot take ownership or control of the entity or its assets.Nevada has the added benefit of no state fiduciary income taxes on trust income allowing for greater planning flexibility.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/65f86d71014f570b1c27f145/1713413418453-XIYXN2YJDMCG7ORFZDEE/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="844"><media:title type="plain">Asset Protection Trusts</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust Checklist</title><category>Blog</category><category>Uncategorized</category><dc:creator></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 11 Mar 2020 20:00:15 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.premiertrust.com/insights/2020/03/11/irrevocable-life-insurance-trust-checklist</link><guid isPermaLink="false">65f86d71014f570b1c27f145:66205c5b24c52457af56bf41:6627dd0bfd382c7effe62a3b</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

  <p>On the surface the administration of an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT) looks rather simple, however, life insurance is a complex trust investment asset with very unique characteristics requiring special attention. If a friend/family member does not have experience serving as trustee of an ILIT the administration can be problematic.The two most common mistakes we see in the administration of an ILIT by individual trustees:▲  Failure to properly prepare the right of withdrawal or “Crummey” notices▲  Failure to monitor and maintain the life insurance policyIf the administration is not handled properly the IRS can challenge the use of the contributions to the ILIT and the death benefit may be subject to gift and/or estate taxes. Due to our highly litigious society, there has been an increasing amount of lawsuits against trustees related to their supervision of trust assets. As a corporate fiduciary we highly recommend naming a professional to handle the administration of an ILIT.The trustee must always follow the terms of the trust document. The list below is a checklist of the duties performed by Premier Trust when it is named as trustee of an ILIT. This is not an exhaustive list because all trust documents and/or life insurance policies are not the same, but these are some general guidelines.&nbsp;

  <p>Clients with a net worth high enough to be subject to the estate tax will often have substantial illiquid assets as part of their overall investment portfolio. Accessing the value of these types of assets for liquidity to pay estate taxes (due within nine months of death) often results in accepting prices that are forced lower by this time constraint.To avoid this fire sale situation, clients often choose to liquidate more of their investment assets to cover estate taxes. They sell marketable securities and take withdrawals from investment and brokerage accounts.
<h3>Why Use an ILIT?</h3>
<p>The use of a properly structured and administered Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT) and the life insurance it holds can provide the liquidity necessary to cover estate taxes. This avoids or limits the sale of other investment assets managed by an advisor.ILITs can help accomplish other planning goals as well. When a client does not have a taxable estate, life insurance inside an ILIT can help leverage the amount of money that passes to the client's heirs. Since the death benefit will be received inside an ILIT, the client can dictate through the terms of the trust just how the insurance proceeds are to be used and allocated to the beneficiaries. If drafted properly, the trust may protect the insurance proceeds from the beneficiaries' creditors, including potential divorcing spouses. If dynasty provisions are included, the trust can prevent future depletion of trust assets by eliminating estate taxes paid by future generations on the assets held in the trust, for as long as state law permits.Discussing estate planning and life insurance with clients can help advisors retain assets by minimizing loss due to estate taxes and potential creditor claims of heirs. Using Premier Trust as an independent trustee to administer trusts mitigates the chance for potential poaching of client assets by other advisors, banks or trust companies. Advisors become a valuable resource to help clients accomplish long-term goals.
<h3>Steps to Administering an ILIT</h3>
<ol>
<li><em>Send the Gift Request</em>
<ul>
<li>As trustee, we will receive notice when the premium is due and request the amount from the grantor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Send Notices of Rights of Withdrawl</em>
<ul>
<li>Once the gift is received from the grantor, we will send rights of withdrawal notices or "crummey letters" to the beneficiaries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Pay the Premium</em>
<ul>
<li>After the right of withdrawal period has lapsed, we will pay the premium to the life insurance company.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/65f86d71014f570b1c27f145/1713413417837-UF8C96JXVIFRUNMFYAVK/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="800" height="533"><media:title type="plain">Irrevocable Life Insurance Trusts</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Charitable Trusts</title><category>Uncategorized</category><dc:creator></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 05 Mar 2020 20:00:04 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.premiertrust.com/insights/2020/03/05/charitable-trusts</link><guid isPermaLink="false">65f86d71014f570b1c27f145:66205c5b24c52457af56bf41:6627dd08fd382c7effe629db</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

  <p>Charitable trusts are irrevocable trusts that include both taxable and non-taxable beneficiaries. They are popular estate planning vehicles that can be structured to provide the grantor with flexible planning options.There are two basic types of charitable trusts: charitable remainder trusts and charitable lead trusts. In both instances, the grantor can contribute highly appreciated assets to fund the trust, avoid the capital gains tax on the sale of the assets, and receive an income tax deduction for a portion of the amount donated in the year of funding.
<h3>Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT):</h3>
<p>A charitable remainder trust distributes income to the non-charitable beneficiary for life or a team of 20 years, then donates the remaining balance of the trust to designated charities. When utilized properly, a charitable remainder trust can greatly reduce the tax liability of an individual and their estate, leaving more of the grantor's assets for generations to come. There are two main types of charitable remainder trusts:
<ul>
<li><strong>Charitable Remainder Annuity Trust (CRAT) - </strong>A CRAT pays the grantor a fixed dollar amount annually determined when the trust is established. The grantor cannot make additions to a CRAT.</li>
<li><strong>Charitable Remainder UniTrust (CRUT) - </strong>A CRUT pays the grantor a fixed percentage of the trust's value annually compounded at the start of each year. The grantor can make additions to the CRUT.
<ul>
<li><strong>NIMCRUT:</strong> A popular variation of the CRUT provides for the distribution of a set percentage of net income with right of make-up, known as NIMCRUT. It is very flexible since income can be deferred for years and then paid out as needed, similar to a retirement plan, but without the IRS restrictions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Charitable Lead Trust (CLT):</h3>
<p>A CLT distributes a portion of the trust's income to the charitable beneficiary for a specified period of years or designated lifetime after which the balance is distributed to non-charitable beneficiaries, either back to the grantor or the grantor's heirs. They can be set up to provide an annuity or unitrust payment, similar to CRTs. CLTs are useful planning tools for grantors who are not concerned with receiving current income from donated assets and are more interested in removing assets from their taxable estate.Premier Trust can run gift illustrations for clients and professionals.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/65f86d71014f570b1c27f145/1713888529068-NYY208B6ER5A8UMAZMG0/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="800" height="451"><media:title type="plain">Charitable Trusts</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Special Needs Trusts</title><category>Blog</category><dc:creator></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 03 Mar 2020 20:00:56 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.premiertrust.com/insights/2020/03/03/special-needs-trusts</link><guid isPermaLink="false">65f86d71014f570b1c27f145:66205c5b24c52457af56bf41:66209c7824c52457af6a997a</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

  <h3>What are a Special Needs Trust (SNT)?</h3>
<p>A Special Needs Trust (SNT) is an irrevocable trust created to ensure that a beneficiary who has a disability can enjoy the use of property held in trust for his or her benefit.An SNT may be established to prevent a beneficiary from losing access to essential government benefits such as:
<ul>
<li>Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI or SSD)</li>
<li>Supplemental Security Income (SSI)</li>
<li>Federal and state-sponsored Medicaid programs</li>
</ul>
<p>SNTs are frequently established for the benefit of a person who has a disability to receive an inheritance, personal injury settlement, proceeds for criminal injuries, or insurance settlements. They are often set up under the guidance of a structured settlement planner in cooperation with a qualified legal and financial team.
<h3>Who can Establish an SNT?</h3>
<p>The person with a disability, a parent, guardian or court can establish a self-settled SNT for the sole benefit of a disabled person under the age of 65. Under current social security law, the trust assets are not counted as assets available to the beneficiary for qualification purposes. If the beneficiary had the right to outright possession of the assets, the trust must include "payback" provisions for Medicaid upon the death of a beneficiary. Third-party SNTs that are established by anyone other than the beneficiary (or someone acting on their behalf), do not have an age restriction and do not need to include Medicaid "payback" provisions.Permissible payments or distributions from a Special Needs Trust are typically not regarded as black and white. Several factors must be considered when administering an SNT, such as knowing the government benefit programs available to the beneficiary.
<h3>Why You Should Work with an Independent Trust Company</h3>
<p>Special Needs Trusts are complicated instruments that are affected by many different competing laws, rules and regulations. Competent professionals specializing in this unique aspect of the law should be engaged to draft the documents. Great care must be taken in the choice of appropriate trustees to administer the trust. An independent trust company is often the preferred trustee since it can act more efficiently to secure government benefits than a court-appointed official or an individual that does not have the expertise.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/65f86d71014f570b1c27f145/1713413417436-MJKNFLBNXEC993P14MI8/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="640" height="425"><media:title type="plain">Special Needs Trusts</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Dynasty Trusts</title><category>Blog</category><dc:creator></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2020 20:00:37 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.premiertrust.com/insights/2020/02/27/dynasty-trusts</link><guid isPermaLink="false">65f86d71014f570b1c27f145:66205c5b24c52457af56bf41:66209c7524c52457af6a9897</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

  <h3>What is a Dynasty Trust?</h3>
<p>A dynasty trust is an irrevocable trust that contains "dynasty" provisions that instruct the trustee to hold the assets placed in the trust for more than one generation. The duration or life of the trust depends on the laws of the state under which it is governed, commonly referred to as the "rule against perpetuities."If the assets transferred to the trust are exempt from Generation-Skipping Transfer tax (GST tax), then they may benefit future generations without further estate or transfer taxes.Dynasty provisions can be included in any trust:
<ul>
<li>Revocable trusts</li>
<li>Irrevocable life insurance trusts (ILITs)</li>
<li>Asset protection trusts</li>
<li>Credit-Shelter trusts</li>
<li>Trusts established by a will (Testamentary trusts)</li>
</ul>
<h3>What are the Benefits of a Dynasty Trust?</h3>
<p>The benefits of holding assets in trust for high net worth clients is obvious: trust assets grow and compound within the trust fee of estate taxes that would normally be levied at the death of each generation. This is how family wealth has been created, for example, the Rockefellers, Carnegies, etc.Under reasonable growth and income tax assumptions, $1 million left in a typical one-generation trust for 115 years (within the time periods permitted in most states) would grow to about $67 million. The same $1 million in a Dynasty Trust would grow to almost$220 million, about 3.2 times more due to compounding growth and estate tax savings. There are several states that permit perpetual trusts, and in Nevada, a dynasty trust can last 365 years. Compounding effects longer than 115 years are more staggerings.<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-26-at-2.18.16-PM.png" alt="dynasty trusts" class="alignnone wp-image-4285 size-full" />
<h3>Who Can Apply for a Dynasty Trust?</h3>
<p>Dynasty trusts are not only for the wealthy. As is common with irrevocable trusts that have been established by someone other than the beneficiary, the assets held in the trust are exempt from creditor claims of the beneficiary. That includes divorcing spouses. Today, more than half of marriages end in divorce.By incorporating "dynasty" provisions into their planning vehicles, clients of even modest wealth can protect their children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and further from the loss of assets.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/65f86d71014f570b1c27f145/1713413416945-6TTMDDQKT4BQQWD2U1QR/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="640" height="426"><media:title type="plain">Dynasty Trusts</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>The Trust Settlement Process</title><category>Blog</category><dc:creator></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2020 23:25:55 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.premiertrust.com/insights/2020/02/26/the-trust-settlement-process</link><guid isPermaLink="false">65f86d71014f570b1c27f145:66205c5b24c52457af56bf41:66209c6d24c52457af6a9658</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

  <h3>"If I am from a state other than Nevada, why should I have my trust administered in Nevada?"</h3>
<p>Typically, if a state has a personal income tax they probably also have a fiduciary state income tax. Nevada has neither tax, and this helps reduce the erosion of trust assets by the tax rate. The trust will always have to file a federal income tax return, but using a Nevada situs trustee will usually avoid any need to file a state fiduciary income tax return. However, if a beneficiary of a Nevada trust receives a trust distribution, that may subject that individual to their own state's personal income tax filings.
<h3>About Nevada Dynasty Trusts</h3>
<p>Nevada Dynasty trust laws can have a trust last for 365 years. This may allow a trust to avoid the estate tax arena for multiple generations. Dynasty trusts are how wealth is accumulated by the compounding effect of its assets.
<h3>Nevada is considered one of the best state jurisdictions for domestic asset protection.</h3>
<p>Nevada laws now permit the decanting of an irrevocable trust. Many clients do not like to use irrevocable trusts as they feel the document can never be changed. However, Nevada laws are very flexible and allow this ability to decant a current trust to another new trust, should circumstances change to warrant the prior trust to be disregarded.Nevada allows directed trusts. This provides for the duties within the administration of the trust to be separated to have the trustee perform administrative functions and an outside investment adviser to manage the trust portfolio. Many clients like the idea of splitting these duties so one entity does not control all aspects of their estate plan.
<h3>Why Premier Trust?</h3>
<p>Premier Trust was created as a directed trustee since we began in 2001. We are not attorneys, CPA's or investment managers, so the client can be assured that as trustee, we will keep their trusted team in place after they have passed.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/65f86d71014f570b1c27f145/1713413415640-126U5JJ8ZIR8B45F4LOC/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="800" height="533"><media:title type="plain">Benefits of Nevada</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Trust Myths and Realities</title><category>Blog</category><dc:creator></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2020 20:00:20 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.premiertrust.com/insights/2020/02/25/trust-myths-and-realities</link><guid isPermaLink="false">65f86d71014f570b1c27f145:66205c5b24c52457af56bf41:66209c6a24c52457af6a9582</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

  <p>The complexity of some trusts has fostered many myths, most arising from misinformed media portrayal and a general misunderstanding of how a trust works. Here are some of the most common myths:
<h3>Myth #1: Trusts are only for the rich.</h3>
<p>This is categorically incorrect. Trusts are the framework providing for the security and wellbeing of one's heirs. Trusts may protect an inheritance from an heir's creditors, including in certain states, a divorcing spouse. Divorce and creditor protection are not benefits limited to the rich. You do not need to be wealthy to benefit from a trust.
<h3>Myth #2:p Trusts are used to hide money or avoid income taxes.</h3>
<p>Again, this is incorrect. Trusts are generally reporting entities to the IRS and other taxing authorities and are not used to hide money from the authorities. Trusts pay taxes.
<h3>Myth #3: Trusts Create "trust fund kids."</h3>
<p>Generally, trust assets are finite and beneficiaries do not have unlimited resources. The media portrays beneficiaries as "trust fund kids," heirs that are "loafers" who enjoy the high life, living off of trust assets. Modern trust documents often require that beneficiaries meet certain qualifications to receive a distribution, such as being currently employed. This misconception is similar to the "reading of the will" often dramatized in movies and television; this simply does not happen in normal life.

  <p>A trust is a legal contract that involves three main parties: a grantor, a trustee, and a beneficiary.
<h4>Grantor</h4>
<p>The grantor is the creator of the trust, also known as the "trustor," "settlor," or "trust maker." The grantor of a trust is held to a higher degree of competency then if he or she was simply creating a will.
<h4>Trustee</h4>
<p>A trustee is an individual or entity that is responsible for carrying out the terms of the trust document. A successor trustee takes control of the trust after the initial trustee resigns, passes away, or becomes incapacitated.
<h4>Beneficiary</h4>
<p>A beneficiary is a person or organization that benefits from the assets in the trust.The main benefit of an estate plan utilizing a trust is that the trustee will administer the assets in accordance with the grantor's specific wishes, goals, and objectives as stated in the trust document. This assures the orderly disposition of the client's assets to achieve the desired outcome, limited only by the imagination of the grantor at the time the document is drafted.Trusts can be revocable or irrevocable, the former is changeable by the grantor during their lifetime and becomes irrevocable at their death.Revocable trusts set the stage for the disposition of their assets similar to a will, however, they generally avoid probate administration and the costs associated with it. To gain this advantage, be sure that assets are retitled into the name of the revocable trust.Irrevocable trusts are not readily changeable and are used to accomplish specific goals in estate and financial planning. They may contain provisions that instruct the trustee to distribute assets outright to beneficiaries at specific ages or to retain assets in trust for multiple generations.

  <p>When clients formulate their estate plan or update an existing plan, one of the most important decisions they must make is who will be the trustee. Will they appoint a family member, a friend, or an Independent Corporate Trustee, such as Premier Trust.
<h3>The Most Important Factors To Consider About Corporate Trustees:</h3>
<h4>Trusts are complex legal documents with major tax and family implications.</h4>
<p>Corporate Trustees have professional knowledge and expertise in handling the complexities of trust administration.
<h4>Trust administration is time-consuming and can be complex.</h4>
<p>Corporate trustees have the financial and operational systems to provide timely accurate statements and reports to meet regulatory and beneficiary requirements.
<h4>Trusts may continue for many generations.</h4>
<p>Corporate Trustees have a perpetual life. They will not die, become incompetent or go through distracting personal issues, all of which can happen to an individual family member or a friend who may be named as trustee.
<h4>Trust administration demands a high level of fiduciary responsibility and confidentiality.</h4>
<p>Corporate Trustees are regulated and monitored by state or federal government agencies and are held to a much higher standard than that of individual trustees.
<h4>Dealing with the distribution of trust assets to beneficiaries can be emotional.</h4>
<p>Corporate Trustees do not have the personal biases that a family member or a friend may have toward one or more beneficiaries. Corporate Trustees are not affected by emotions and personal agendas. Their job is to follow the client's instructions objectively and faithfully.

  <p>By Steven J. Oshins, Esq., AEP (Distinguished)Financial planners are constantly looking for additional ways to save taxes for their clients and, at the same time, increase their assets under management. One often-overlooked concept is to use trusts to save state income taxes, especially for those clients who reside in a state with a high state income tax. For example, certain types of trusts can be set up under Nevada's special laws in order to avoid state income taxes.
<h3>The Financial Advisor and Income Tax Savings</h3>
<p>Income tax savings is generally the most appreciated work we do for our clients given that they can personally enjoy the savings, but yet the planning opportunities are frequently missed. Our clients like instant gratification and therefore tend to be much more excited about saving income taxes now and every year into the future as opposed to the less-exciting estate tax savings strategies that often isn't fully appreciated until the person's death when it can be quantified.Financial advisors likely share the same level of excitement for income tax savings now versus estate tax savings later. For example, assume there are assets that are being taxed at California's highest state income tax rate of 13.3%. Therefore, every year the investment portfolio is getting reduced by roughly 13.3% of the income. The client doesn't like it, nor does the financial advisor since the financial advisor is being paid based on a percentage of assets under management.What if there are ways to avoid the 13.3% state income tax? Both the client and the advisor would be ecstatic. This article focuses on this issue and describes the ways to address it to save state income taxes.
<h3>Income Taxation of a Trust</h3>
<p>An irrevocable trust can have its income either taxed to the settlor, taxed to one or more beneficiaries or taxed to the trust except to the extent the income is distributed to one or more beneficiaries.A trust which has its income taxed to the settlor is generally called a grantor trust. Such a trust is created by violating one or more of the grantor trust provisions in the tax code. Alternatively, a trust can be taxed to a beneficiary by specifically violating IRC Section 678. This is often called a beneficiary defective trust. A trust that distributes all of its income to a beneficiary is called a simple trust. However, this article focuses on another income tax option called a non-grantor or complex trust. A non-grantor trust is an irrevocable trust in which the income is taxed to the trust to the extent it isn't distributed, but to the extent, it is distributed it is taxed to the beneficiaries to whom it is distributed.
<h3>Income Tax Savings</h3>
<p>In the 2019 tax year, a trust reaches the highest Federal income tax bracket of 37% at only $12,750 of taxable income. At that point, certain types of income are also subject to the 3.8% net investment income surtax. Therefore, at least from a pure federal perspective, since most beneficiaries are in a lower income tax bracket there is a significant advantage in distributing the income from the trust to the beneficiaries who are in lower tax brackets.However, with many state income tax rates as high as they are even for trust beneficiaries who are in a lower federal income tax bracket, there are often substantial state income tax advantages that can be obtained by leaving income inside a trust. In addition to looking at this from the trust beneficiaries' perspectives, there are also plenty of high-net-worth individuals who reside in a state with a high state income tax and can easily afford to transfer substantial wealth into a non-grantor trust for the benefit of that person's descendants and other intended beneficiaries without worrying about the loss of cash flow. Those assets often can be gifted to a trust that saves significant state income tax.
<h3>What Causes a State Income Tax?</h3>
<p>Each state that has a state income tax has different rules that apply to determine whether the trust is subject to a state income tax in that state. Some states tax an inter vivos trust that is established by a resident of that state. Some states tax a trust that was established under a will of a resident of that state. Some states tax a trust that is being administered in the state. Some states tax a trust if it has a trustee who resides in that state. Some states tax a trust based on whether beneficiaries of the trust reside in that state (which was recently ruled unconstitutional in the <em>Kaestner</em> case). There fore, each individual situation must be analyzed in designing the trust and choosing appropriate trustees to manage the trust.
<h3>Simpler than you may Think</h3>
<p>Many financial planners fail to consider using a trust jurisdiction that is different than the client's home jurisdiction either because of a fear that it is overly complicated or a fear that it will be too expensive. It is very easy to appoint a co-trustee in a jurisdiction that doesn't tax a trust. That co-trustee is often a trust company or bank. This co-trustee need not have all trustee powers and can even serve principally as a jurisdictional trustee with a more limited role while other co-trustees can have the investment and distribution powers. And since many of the trust companies and banks frequently serve in this more limited trustee capacity, they generally have a low flat-fee that should not be a cause for concern, especially when compared to the much more substantial income tax savings that the family is achieving by using this strategy.
<h3>Moving an Existing Trust to Save State Income Taxes</h3>
<p>In addition to planning for a newly-created irrevocable trust, there are a number of existing trusts that can be moved to a new jurisdiction to achieve the state income tax savings described in this article. The trustee or trust protector might have the power under the trust agreement to move the trust to another jurisdiction. This is done in writing with a new co-trustee in the new jurisdiction accepting the co-trusteeship.If there is no provision allowing the trustee or trust protector to move the trust to another jurisdiction, then the trustee might be able to "decant" the trust by distributing the trust assets into a second trust that is established in the new jurisdiction. Decanting has become extremely popular and can often be used to fix inflexible trusts.Yet another option would be for the trustee to petition the local court for approval to move the trust or for approval to modify the trust to allow the trustee or trust protector to move the trust.
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Selecting an appropriate trust situs in order to save state income taxes is an underutilized strategy. This article is intended to position this strategy as one that should be considered by the estate planner whenever a new irrevocable trust is being formed and also to give the estate planner some opportunities to move existing irrevocable trusts to jurisdictions with no state income tax. Financial planners who take advantage of these opportunities should find themselves busy with more work than they can handle given the number of trusts that are likely currently domiciled in jurisdictions with a state income tax.<em>About the Author:</em><em>Steven J.

  <p>In part one of this series, we discussed how to attract and retain the generation X &amp; Y children of your current clients. This is an important strategy for retaining assets.  According to the Investment Management Consultants Association, only 2% of children keep inheritances with their parent's financial advisor.As your core baby boomer client base continues to age and draw down assets, you're probably already thinking of ways to generate new revenue. In this article, we will discuss how to grow by successfully positioning and marketing your firm to attract new Gen X &amp; Y clients.
<h3>What Do Gen X &amp; Y Want?</h3>
<p>To attract them, we need to first understand them.<strong>Empowerment: </strong>Gen X and Y clients want an empowering and engaging approach. They want to be listened to, not spoken down to. They want to make their own decisions, not have you choose for them. They want your advice, but they also want to be part of the conversation. To engage them, tell them your story. They don't want to work with a big faceless corporation, they want to work with a person they like and trust. Be sure that your website and marketing materials explain why you are in this business and what makes you different.<strong>Be Transparent: </strong>If you consider what they have seen growing up, (the energy crisis and 2008 financial crisis) then their general distrust of the financial industry makes sense. To build trust be transparent about your commissions, fees and all aspects of working with your firm. Focus on educating and explaining your investment decision process, because the more they buy into your strategy the more likely they are to trust you and stay with you.<strong>Technology: </strong>Gen X and Y have grown up with technology and are accustomed to having anything they want to know to be one click away. In fact, according to a Salesforce.com survey, 89% of millennials and 83% of Gen Xers said having modern tools for financial planning was an important factor when selecting a financial advisor, compared with 71% of boomer investors responding to the survey.To attract Gen X and Y clients to your firm you need to offer them the transparency and technology they have become accustomed to. They will expect 24/7 access to their accounts via a user-friendly client portal. They also want you to take a holistic approach to their wealth. They expect you to take into account their entire financial picture including their disparate 401K, education funding, and IRA accounts when helping them approach their investments, tax strategies, retirement, and estate plan.<strong>Services:</strong> As mentioned above, Gen X and Y clients want you to be their financial quarterback and offer them a range of services from estate planning to income tax strategies to advise on how to invest their 401K. Be prepared to bring in different experts to manage the parts you don't specialize in. Clients will appreciate your referrals and management of all the moving parts.<strong>Engage: </strong>Gen X and Y clients will also expect a different level of engagement. Be prepared to do fewer in-person meetings and more virtual engagements. They will not want to fill out a stack of paper forms so have electronic versions available with an e-signature option to streamline the process.<strong>Finding Gen X &amp; Y Clients</strong>If your firm is used to working with boomers and older generations, then you have some work to do to find younger clients. Here are some ideas to get you started.Look in your community to determine the companies that employ large numbers of high potentials. A Fortune 1000 company, a large medical facility, or large law firm are all good possibilities. Used LinkedIn and other social networks to get connected in these communities. Seek venues to speak to these audiences in their office environments.
<ul>
<li>Find local groups of young professionals or attend industry conferences and meet them at these venues.</li>
<li>Gen X and Y clients tend to enjoy connecting with businesses and professionals who consistently share interesting, unique content. Keep your website, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter pages up-to-date with interesting content and events. Create informational pieces, blog posts, and videos to share via e-mail, on your website, and in online publications. They can educate your target market and promote you as a trustworthy expert. Make sure to keep your company website up-to-date. If a Gen X or Y prospect thinks your website is old and outdated, he or she might assume the same is true for your practice.</li>
<li>Leverage current client relationships. Working with clients' children, grandchildren, or beneficiaries can be a successful strategy to attract Gen X clients. Ask your clients for their children's or grandchildren's names, dates of birth, and contact information. Consider using a CRM system to record information and send reminders to call and e-mail periodically.</li>
<li>Consider having junior advisors reach out to younger generations. They can send handwritten notes or offer free financial overviews to prospects, for example.</li>
<li>Use LinkedIn to focus on topics relevant to your audience's professional and financial needs, and join groups that include your target audience. LinkedIn's primary purpose is networking, so don't hesitate to ask for introductions.</li>
<li>Host a variety of events including large educational events, webinars, and more intimate affairs like a cooking class or trivia game. Also consider themed events based on different life events such as dealing with divorce, a career change or prepping for kids. They expect pertinent information and expertise - and are often wary of promotional marketing. Different types of events can attract Gen X clients and help secure their loyalty.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Work With A Company You Can Trust</h3>
<p>Once a few Gen X and Y clients have signed on with you, ask why they chose your services and why they continue to work with you. Once you understand what persuaded them, don't be surprised if this strategy succeeds with others.To attract Gen X and Y clients you might have to make some adjustments. With an informed, strategic marketing plan, however, you can quickly grow Generation X and Y client base who may need your services for many years to come.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/65f86d71014f570b1c27f145/1713413412740-9CODJR7LCQWB1181ASVT/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="450"><media:title type="plain">Estate Planning: Attracting Generation X &#x26; Y Clients Part Two</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Benefits of a Corporate Trustee</title><category>Blog</category><dc:creator></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2019 18:23:35 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.premiertrust.com/insights/2019/05/31/benefits-of-a-corporate-trustee</link><guid isPermaLink="false">65f86d71014f570b1c27f145:66205c5b24c52457af56bf41:66209c6324c52457af6a932b</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

  <p>Life is not a dress rehearsal, which is why protecting the wealth you have accumulated over your lifetime should not be left to chance.Asking a friend to be your trustee is like asking a friend to perform open heart surgery on you. Sure, he or she could do it, but you probably will not like the outcome.Having a friend or family member designated as your trustee after you die can be more of a burden than a privilege. It is a time consuming and onerous responsibility. The average person does not understand their fiduciary responsibility, personal liability, legal requirements, and time commitment. A non-professional trustee can become overwhelmed by the legal minefields which can lead to unintentional and costly mistakes, for which they are personally liable. The way to solve this problem is to bring in a corporate trustee. The corporate trustee will help to protect your assets and make life a lot easier for your friend or family member.
<h3>What is a Corporate Trustee?</h3>
<p>A corporate trustee is there to protect your beneficiaries, maneuver the legal maze, verify that distributions follow your request and intentions, and most of all allow you to keep your team in place, such as your CPA, financial professional, and attorney. They also help to remove potential financial strife between family members because the trustee is independent and required to follow your wishes and document all financial transactions.
<h3>The Benefits of Having a Corporate Trustee?</h3>
<p>A corporate trustee may be one of the best financial decisions you could make for protecting your financial wishes and having the confidence that the wealth you have built over your lifetime will continue to benefit your spouse, partner, children, and grandchildren by protecting and distributing your assets in the manner you have requested in your will and trust.Best of all, it is very easy to add a corporate trustee to your trust document. There is no cost to designate a corporate trustee in your trust. The only time they charge a fee is when they step in to act as a trustee or co-trustee (at death or incapacity). There could be an added tax benefit when the trustee is located in a state that offers a more favorable income tax treatment.
<h3>Name Premier Trust As Your Successor Trustee</h3>
<p>Naming a corporate trustee, such as Premier Trust, ensures a client's wishes are followed as stated in the trust document. Contact your attorney to include the following items in the trust document:
<ul>
<li><span><strong>"Premier Trust, Inc., A Nevada Chartered Trust Company"</strong></span> as your successor trustee.</li>
<li>A situs changing provision. Premier Trust, as a Nevada chartered trust company, must have the ability to move the situs of administration to Nevada.</li>

  <p><span>The young are getting richer. This may be happening for two reasons. First, wealthy parents are no longer waiting until their death to transfer wealth; they are making transfers during their lifetime. Second, the technology boom has resulted in many IPO’s, creating higher wealth at younger ages than we've experienced before. </span></p>
<p><span>In the past, advisors focused their practices on Baby Boomers, ignoring Gen X and Y investors. This happened to not be the case anymore. When combined, Gen X and Gen Y have overtaken Baby Boomers as the wealthiest generations in history. Here is the breakdown: </span>
<ul>
<li><span>Baby Boomers (born 1946 – 1964): 76.7 million </span></li>
<li><span>Gen X (born 1965 – 1976): 49.1 million </span></li>
<li><span>Gen Y (born 1977 – 2000): 77 million </span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Create Relationships<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/financial-advisors-1.jpg" alt="Estate Planning for Gen X and Y" class="alignright wp-image-1336" /></h3>
<p><span>According to a study conducted by Pershing, 90% of heirs say they will move their assets to another investment firm once they receive their inheritance. This can cause a problem for advisors who hope to retain their current clients' assets after it is passed on. </span><span>In order for the clients' heir to see you as "their" advisor, you'll need to create a relationship. This way when the wealth is transferred they won't see you as just their parent's advisors. </span><span>The best way to bring heirs into the fold is through introductions from their parents. Due to the generation gap, some parents have difficulty talking to their heirs about their financial situations, wishes, and concerns. As their advisor, you are in a unique position to create an environment that fosters healthy financial conversations. You can include the heirs in the meeting with their parents to discuss investment and estate planning for Gen X and Y. </span><span>The heirs should rely on you to be a resource to help manage their own assets and inheritance. You will need to build a strong relationship with them by the time they need help. One way to do this is by becoming their educational resource on all financial related issues. These areas might include trust services or when other advisors lack expertise. </span><span>In order to educate both parents and heirs about trusts, explain they help to accomplish their wealth transfer goals. They also will protect heirs from future creditor claims. This will help establish the foundation for you to earn the trust of Gen X and Y heirs and retain assets under management.</span>
<h3>Advise Generation X and Y</h3>
<p><span>According to an article published in onwallstreet a recent survey of 642 high net worth and ultra-high net worth investors, defined as those having 3 million in liquid assets in addition to what they have already invested, revealed that:</span><span>The majority of survey participants had some kind of estate plan in place. However, many wealthy individuals, especially Gen X and Gen Y, do not have a trust;</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Only 51% of survey respondents had a revocable trust and only 22% had an irrevocable trust</span></li>
<li><span>43% of respondents believed that outlining their wants in a will replaced the need for a trust and another 31% were procrastinating</span></li>
<li><span>Respondents did not have trusts because of “misunderstanding and lack of professional guidance.”</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Also according to survey results, 43% of respondents believed that outlining their wants in a will replaced the need for a trust. Another 31% were procrastinating, while 17% didn’t think they had enough money for a trust. </span><span>The survey results highlight that there is a huge opening for advisors to offer advanced estate planning for Gen X and Y heirs and the Baby Boomers. By educating your clients about all of the estate planning options for transferring their wealth to Gen X and Gen Y heirs, including the facts about how to use Trusts as an essential part of an estate plan, you position yourself as a trusted expert and build a long-lasting relationship for multiple generations. </span>

  <h1><span>Save State Income Taxes Using a Nevada Incomplete Non-Grantor Trust</span></h1>
<p><span><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/brian-and-steve-bio.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3677 aligncenter" /></span><span>Private Letter Ruling 201310002 (released March 8, 2013) is great news for taxpayers wishing to save a significant amount of state income tax. This Ruling approved the Nevada Incomplete Gift Non-Grantor Trust (“NING Trust”) technique, thus opening the door for residents of states with a state income tax to significantly reduce that tax.</span><span>Taxpayers in high tax states with large unrealized capital gains or a regular stream of ordinary income from an investment portfolio have always wanted to find a way to eliminate or minimize their state income tax exposure without giving up the economic benefit of the underlying assets. Over time, such a strategy can produce dramatic results. </span><span>Suppose, for example, that Taxpayer: (1) has a $5 million investment portfolio that produces $300,000 of interest, dividends and capital gains each year, (2) lives in a state with a ten percent state income tax rate and (3) taxpayer’s home state doesn’t tax trusts based on the residence of the grantor. A taxpayer could save $30,000 per year (10% x $300,000) by transferring the portfolio to trust in a state that does not tax trust income. Moreover, if the Taxpayer can reinvest the annual tax savings at a six percent after-tax rate of return, the savings would grow to $1,103,568 after 20 years. This amount could be much higher if Taxpayer funds the trust with low basis assets that would later be sold by the trust, although Taxpayer might have to be careful about how soon the assets were sold. </span>
<ol>
<li><span>To accomplish these goals, the trust would need to:</span></li>
<li><span>Be self-settled to give the grantor the ability to receive distributions;</span></li>
<li><span>Be a non-grantor trust so that the grantor isn’t taxed on the trust income at home state tax rates; and</span></li>
<li><span>Give the grantor a non-general power of appointment to direct the disposition of the trust property.</span></li>
<li><span>In addition, the transfer of the portfolio to the trust would have to be an incomplete gift, includible in the grantor’s estate at death.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span>Successful Rulings </span></h3>
<p><span>The main obstacle to creating such a trust is giving up enough control to avoid grantor trust status without giving up so much control that a completed gift is made. Prior to 1997, it wasn’t possible to do this. Treasury Regulations Section 1.677(a)-1(d) makes a trust a grantor trust if the grantor’s creditors can reach the trust assets under applicable state law. Unfortunately, until that time, the law of all states provided that creditors could look to the assets of a self-settled trust for payment of claims against the grantor. </span><span>This changed when states began enacting statutes allowing self-settled trusts that couldn’t be reached by creditors, commonly referred to as domestic asset protection trusts (DAPTS). Numerous rulings affirmed that these trusts could be used to accomplish all the goals listed above (See PLRs 200148028 (November 30, 2001), 200247013, (November 22, 2002), 200502014, (November 22, 2002) 200612002 (March 24, 2006), 200637025 (September 15, 2006), 200647001 (November 24, 2006), 200715005 (April 13, 2007) and 200731019 (August 3, 2007)). Although such trusts were possible under the law of any DAPT state and were created in all favorable jurisdictions, the trusts came to be known as Delaware Incomplete Gift Non-Grantor Trusts (“DING Trusts”) because of Delaware’s substantial marketing efforts. </span><span>The rulings all used the same method of making transfers incomplete without creating grantor trust status. To avoid a completed gift they gave the grantor a testamentary non-general power of appointment (Reg. §§25.2511-2(b and (c))). To avoid grantor trust status, they created a distribution committee that had to approve any distribution to the grantor. Because the committee members were adverse parties under IRC § 672(a), the trust wasn’t a grantor trust. Significantly, the PLRs also concluded that the powers held by the distribution committee members were not general powers of appointment.</span>
<h3><span>Issues Created by IRS Pronouncements </span></h3>
<p><span>Two IRS pronouncements made practitioners cautious about creating DING trusts from 2007 to 2013, however. First, in IR 2007-27 the IRS announced that it was re-examining the conclusion that the distribution committee members didn’t have general powers of appointment and requested comments. No further action was taken on the issue, however. </span><span>Then, in early 2012, Chief Counsel Advisory 201208026 was issued, creating a shock wave through the estate-planning community. The CCA concluded that retaining a testamentary power of appointment makes a transfer in trust incomplete with respect to the remainder interest, but not with respect to the lead income interest. Thus, if this is the official IRS position, a settlor would have to retain an additional power to make the trust a wholly grantor trust for gift tax purposes. </span>
<h3><span>PLR 201310002 </span></h3>
<p><span>The most straightforward solution to the CCA 201208026 issue would be to give the settlor a lifetime special POA. This power would make the gift incomplete with respect to the lead interest as well as the remainder interest. Of the leading DAPT jurisdictions, however, only Nevada and Alaska have statutes allowing the settlor to retain a lifetime POA that would satisfy the Regulations without subjecting the trust assets to the claims of creditors. Since one exception to the grantor trust rules is to retain a lifetime power of appointment for health, education, maintenance, and support </span><span>(“HEMS”) in a non-fiduciary capacity, Nevada and Alaska seem to be the best jurisdictions for getting around the CCA 101208026 concern. Since Nevada is the only DAPT jurisdiction that has no state income tax and doesn’t allow any class of creditors to pierce through the trust, Nevada has a distinct advantage over other DAPT jurisdictions and therefore is often the jurisdiction of choice. </span><span>A Nevada Incomplete Gift Non-Grantor Trust (“NING Trust”), using a lifetime non-general power of appointment with a HEMS standard, did indeed pass muster with the IRS in PLR 201310002 (and its sister PLRs, 201310003, 201310004, 201310005 and 201310006). The IRS ruled that the trusts were non-grantor trusts for income tax purposes and that the transfers were incomplete for gift tax purposes. Perhaps equally important, the PLR held that the distribution committee members don’t have general powers of appointment. </span>
<h3><span>Planning Implications </span></h3>
<p><span>The PLR should make practitioners much more comfortable about using incomplete gift non-grantor trusts to avoid state income tax, evidently indicating that the IRS has dropped the issue it raised in IR 2007-127. It also suggests that Nevada and Alaska are the preferred jurisdictions for setting up such a trust. While there may be other methods of making a transfer incomplete with respect to both the remainder interest and the lead interest without triggering grantor trust status, these methods are untested in the context of irrevocable gift non-grantor trusts. Other DAPT jurisdictions could change their laws if taxpayers are unsuccessful in obtaining favorable PLRs under their self-settled trust statutes, but even if they do, valuable time will be lost in waiting for the changes. Finally, note that the increased applicable exclusion amounts currently in effect might make these trusts popular for taxpayers with more modest wealth. In the past, taxpayers using these trusts wanted the transfers to be incomplete gifts to avoid payment of gift tax or use of applicable exclusion amount. Now, taxpayers who don’t expect to have a taxable estate may want gifts to be incomplete so they can obtain a basis step-up on the assets at death. </span>
<h3><span>Nevada Trustee Requirement </span></h3>
<p><span>For the trust to qualify as a Nevada trust for legal and tax situs purposes under Chapter 166 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, at least one trustee must be a natural person residing in Nevada, a trust company that maintains an office in Nevada, or a bank that possesses trust powers and that maintains an office in Nevada. Individuals wishing to set up a NING Trust who may not have any individual contacts in Nevada generally use a trust company based in Nevada to serve in that capacity. </span><span>Portions of this article come from a previously-published article co-authored by Steven J.

  <h3><span>What is a Charitable Remainder Trust?</span></h3>
<h1><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/leah-and-sue-bio-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3663 aligncenter" /></h1>
<p><span>A charitable remainder trust is an irrevocable trust used to reduce the taxable income of an individual. A charitable remainder trust distributes income to the non-charitable beneficiary for life or a term of 20 years, then donates the remaining balance of the trust to designated charities. A charitable remainder trust is one way to gain diversification in a concentrated position, without facing large tax liabilities.</span>
<h3><span>How Charitable Remainder Trusts Can Help Save on Taxes</span></h3>
<p><span>When a donor contributes to a charitable remainder trust, they receive an immediate income tax deduction equal to the amount of the present value of the remainder interest that will pass to the charity or charities. Excess deductions can be carried forward for up to 5 years. The power of a charitable remainder trust is that it is tax-exempt. The income paid throughout the trust’s term, however, is taxable according to the 4 tier ordering rule. It is taxed in the order of the CRT’s income: ordinary income, capital gain, other income, and corpus.</span><span>The value of a charitable remainder trust will be included in the estate of the donor once they pass away but, the estate will also receive a charitable tax deduction. The remainder of the trust is not taxable to the charity to which it is distributed. A charitable remainder trust is most useful if the grantor has a low basis asset that needs to be sold, without facing large capital gains.</span>
<h3><span>The Basics of Charitable Remainder Trusts</span></h3>
<p><span>There are 4 factors the donor must take into consideration when creating a charitable remainder trust.</span><span>1. The Trust’s Term. A charitable remainder trust’s term can be either the lifetime of the noncharitable beneficiaries or a set period of time, not exceeding 20 years.</span><span>2. The Payout Rate. The payout rate can be no less than 5% and no greater than 50% of the initial contribution to the trust. The higher the payout rate, the lower the present deduction for the donor’s individual income tax.</span><span>3. The Funding Amount. What is the fair market value of the initial contribution to the charitable remainder trust? A charitable remainder trust must pass a 10% remainder test, meaning that there must be an estimated 10%, at a minimum, of the initial contribution left at the end of the trust’s term to distribute to the designated charity.</span><span>4. The Type of Asset. Securities, real estate and cash are all examples of types of assets that can be used to fund a charitable remainder trust.</span><span>The four variables above are what determines the donor’s income tax deduction.</span>
<h3><span>What is the Difference Between a Charitable Remainder Unitrust &amp; a Charitable Remainder Annuity Trust?</span></h3>
<p><span>The main difference between a charitable remainder unitrust (CRUT) and a charitable remainder annuity trust (CRAT) is the consistency in the payout amount and the flexibility to make additional contributions to the trust. With charitable remainder unitrusts, the noncharitable beneficiaries will receive a variable payment based on the revaluation of assets each year. A CRUT is also more flexible as it can accept additions throughout the trust’s term. With charitable remainder annuity trusts, the beneficiaries will receive a fixed payment regardless of any changes in asset value. In addition, a CRAT cannot accept additions after the initial funding of the trust.</span>
<h3><span>Contact Premier Trust to Learn More</span></h3>
<p><span>Charitable remainder trusts can be useful tools in estate planning. When utilized properly, a charitable remainder trust can greatly reduce the tax liability of an individual and their estate, leaving more of the donor’s assets for generations to come. Premier Trust can run gift illustrations for clients and their advisors.

  <p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/leah-bio-1.png" alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-3673" /><span>Both wills and living trusts are legal devices that direct the transfer of assets to heirs. While both are useful estate planning tools, different situations may call for a will, a trust, or both. Knowing the benefits of a trust over a will, will help in your future decisions.</span>
<h4><span>Executor vs. Trustee</span></h4>
<p><span>An executor is appointed through a will. A trustee is appointed through a trust. While an executor must settle an estate, a trustee is responsible for administering a trust for as long as the trust is in existence.</span>
<h4><span>The 4 Benefits of a Trust over a Will</span></h4>
<ol>
<li><span><u>A trust protects your heirs from creditors.</u> With a will, your heirs will eventually own their inheritance. With a trust, the trust continues to own the assets for the benefit of your heirs. Ownership is the key to creditor protection.</span></li>
<li><span><u>A trust avoids probate.</u> Probate is the court process by which a will is proved valid or invalid.¹ A will has to go through the probate process, while a trust does not. This means that, after you pass away, your will must go through the court system and will become public record. Probate also involves court and attorney’s fees, which can be expensive. A living trust can avoid probate and help maintain privacy while preserving your assets by avoiding unnecessary fees.</span></li>
<li><span><u>A trust gives you control, even after you pass away.</u> A will gives you control of who you leave your assets to, but not how or when they get those assets. If you leave your assets in trust, you can dictate how and when your beneficiaries will receive the assets. You can also set up trusts for specific purposes such as education or charitable donations.</span></li>
<li><span><u>Assets can stay in trust for multiple generations.</u> With a will, your assets will be transferred to your heirs as soon as your estate is settled. The Nevada Rule Against Perpetuities rules that assets can stay in trust, in Nevada, for 365 years.²</span></li>
</ol>
<h4><span>Why have a will?<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/shutterstock_204800416-1.jpg" alt="benefits of a trust over a will" class="wp-image-2336 alignright" /></span></h4>
<p><span>Although you now know the benefits of a trust over a will, there are reasons to why a will might be better for you. You cannot appoint a guardian through a trust. One benefit of a will is that it must be used to appoint a guardian for minors. Typically, you will want both a will and a trust. Costs for both wills and trusts can vary greatly depending on a variety of factors. A trust may initially cost slightly more than a will.</span>
<h4><span>Don’t Forget this Important Step!</span></h4>
<p><span>The most important step to creating your revocable living trust is making sure that your assets are titled in the name of the trust. Missing this step can result in your assets being subject to probate which means money to pay court and attorney’s fees that could have gone to your beneficiaries.</span>
<h4><span>Contact Premier Trust, Inc. </span></h4>

<p class="para-style-body"><span>The definition of family has evolved in the United States over the last several generations. Today, the traditional model of a long term marriage between a man and a woman and their children represents only 20% of American families, according to “LoveFamilyMoney,” a 2014 study funded by Allianz. The more common family structure of today is a blended family as we have witnessed a divorce rate in the United States exceeding 50%. </span></p>
<p class="para-style-body"><span>Blended families usually involve married couples where one or both spouses have children from a previous marriage. Surely you remember “Yours, Mine and Ours,” a movie that was originally produced in 1968 and remade in 2005. Among the routine life circumstances highlighted in the movie, blended families can also face complex estate planning challenges. Such challenges arise from issues that happen between spouses or children and their parent and step-parent.</span></p>
<p class="para-style-body"><span>Typically, individuals in blended families want to provide for their current spouse as well as the children from their previous marriage. In some situations, they may also want to provide for the children from their spouse’s previous marriage. This presents an opportunity for advisors to set themselves apart by providing estate-planning solutions designed to meet the needs of today’s blended family. In a blended family, there are varied challenges which can influence your decisions, some include the following:</span></p>
<h4><span>Estate-Planning Challenges</span></h4>
<ul>
<li class="para-style-body"><span>The potentiality for children to be disinherited</span></li>
<li class="para-style-body"><span>Delays in child’s receipt of inheritance until after the death of the step-parent</span></li>
<li class="para-style-body"><span>Desires to protect assets from former spouses</span></li>
<li class="para-style-body"><span>Desires to protect the beneficiary’s inherited assets from future divorcing spouses.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Family Structure and Initial Conversations </span></h3>
<p class="para-style-body"><span>It is essential for an advisor to start the planning process. They map out the family structure so they can clearly understand the implications of various options. </span></p>
<p class="para-style-body"><span>Next, advisors should try to create an environment that encourages open dialogue around personal topics. This environment encourages advisors to present customized solutions that go beyond investment portfolios. Talk about previous marriages, children/stepchildren, and anyone else who might make a claim when your client passes away. Topics should include, but are not limited to the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="para-style-body"><span>Tax issues</span></li>
<li class="para-style-body"><span>Retirement planning</span></li>
<li><span>Support obligations to previous spouse(s) or children</span></li>
<li class="para-style-body"><span>Education-funding options</span></li>
<li class="para-style-body"><span>Parental expectations and responsibilities</span></li>
<li class="para-style-body"><span>Heirs’ personalities and money management skills</span></li>
<li class="para-style-body"><span>Heirs’ spouses, relationships and children</span></li>
<li class="para-style-body"><span>Substance abuse issues or history</span></li>
<li class="para-style-body"><span>Premarital and marital agreements</span></li>
<li class="para-style-body"><span>Inheritance planning and wishes</span></li>
<li class="para-style-body"><span>Living arrangements for when the first spouse passes</span></li>
<li class="para-style-body"><span>Diminished capacity decisions</span></li>
<li class="para-style-body"><span>Beneficiary Designations.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Estate Planning Strategies to Consider</span></h3>
<p class="para-style-body"><span>Estate planning for blended families will most likely involve the use of a trust to spell out the disposition of assets and create an asset protection strategy to protect beneficiaries from potential future creditors and predators. We describe three of the most common trust scenarios below. Please discuss your client’s particulars with an estate-planning attorney to get more specific ideas and advice. </span></p>
<p class="para-style-body"><span>One common trust scenario in blended families is when a husband sets up a living trust and names himself as trustee during his lifetime. Typically the trust says that his wife receives income during her lifetime and the remainder of the trust goes to his children after her passing. On the surface, this may look like a simple solution, but issues can arise when it comes to naming the successor trustee. Who will take control when the husband passes? </span></p>
<p class="para-style-body"><span>Often the husband will name his surviving spouse or one of his children as the trustee without really considering the consequences. The wife and the children often have conflicting interests; the wife needs income and the children want growth. This may cause the wife to make an investment decision that could leave the children with very little. Contrary to this, if the child is a trustee, it may leave the wife with very little income. For that reason, it is important to consider a professional third-party trustee who does not have a personal or financial interest in the family.</span></p>
<h4>Irrevocable Life Insurance</h4>
<p class="para-style-body"><span>A second trust scenario involves using an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT) designed to provide for children/stepchildren with life insurance proceeds and to use the remaining estate to provide for the spouse. The client gifts money to the ILIT, then the trustee of the ILIT purchases a life insurance policy and pays the premiums with the trust’s funds. ILIT’s offer several major advantages: they provide liquidity to the overall estate from the income tax-free death benefits; the death benefit is not included in the client’s overall taxable estate; they provide for the children in an asset-protected trust. </span></p>
<h4>Qualified Terminable Interest Property Trust</h4>
<p class="para-style-body"><span>A third scenario involves the use of a Qualified Terminable Interest Property Trust (QTIP). With a QTIP, the will or revocable trust of the spouse who dies first gives the surviving spouse the right to receive income earned from assets held in trust. This income interest has the effect of deferring the estate taxes on the trust’s principal until the death of the second spouse. In most cases, a QTIP trust is drafted as part of a larger estate plan. It is usually desirable to leave assets in trust to protect the assets from creditors of the beneficiaries, including future divorcing spouses. Trusts that hold assets for multiple generations frequently referred to as dynasty trusts are often recommended by estate planning attorneys.</span></p>
<p class="para-style-body"><span>A properly drafted trust will handle the disposition of financial assets and personal property. Typically, a trust and a will work collectively; a will is still needed to ensure that assets not titled in the name of the trust are transferred according to your client’s wishes. This is commonly referred to as a pour-over will. Additionally, only a will can name a guardian for minor children under the age of eighteen.</span></p>
<p class="para-style-body"><span>By taking steps to include blended families in your estate planning strategy you can set yourself apart from the competition while helping your clients reach their estate planning goals.</span></p>

  <h1><span>Duties of a Successor Trustee</span></h1>
<p><span>Being named successor trustee is not an honor, it is a job. It is a job that comes with great responsibility. We’ve compiled a basic list of the duties of a successor trustee to show you the obligations you might be leaving to a friend or family member and to highlight what a corporate trustee can do for you.</span><span><span>1. Review the Trust:</span> <span>Review the trustee’s powers and the sections dealing with the distribution of the trust property to the beneficiaries. Identify the various individuals associated with the trust.</span></span><span><span>2. Attempt to Locate Will:</span> Contact the attorney’s office to try to obtain a copy of the Will. Ask for any Codicils. Look for later Wills or letters of instruction that may have been left by the decedent. Knowing who acts as the Executor or Personal Representative could prove to be helpful in the transferring of assets from Estate to Trust.</span><span><span>3. Obtain Death Certificate(s):</span> Death certificates will be needed to file death claims for any life insurance benefits and for other transfers. We recommend ordering several certified copies of the death certificate.</span><span><span>4. Notify Post Office of Change of Address:</span> Cancel newspapers, magazines subscriptions and start gathering statements to help determine assets. Cancel any unnecessary services such as cable, phone, internet, cell phone, etc.</span><span><span>5. Contact Attorney:</span> Need to have them prepare a Certificate of Incumbency/Formal Acceptance and a 90-day Notice to Creditors for both the decedent and the trust.</span><span><span>6. Prepare an Inventory of all the Assets of the Trust:</span> All assets will need to be valued as of date of death. This may be necessary to determine a new cost basis for these assets in order to take advantage of the “step- up” in the basis (that is, the “cost”) of the assets.</span><span><span>7. Verify all Assets are Held in the Trust Name:</span> If there are any assets that are not titled in the trust, discuss this with an attorney, who will be able to determine whether the assets will be probated.</span><span><span>8. Secure Home/Property(s):</span> Visit property or if in another state, hire an agent to secure the property and all its contents. Need to change all locks on doors, gates, etc. If the rental property is under lease, contact tenant to inform them of the change of Trustee and the new address to send rents.</span><span><span>9. Vehicle(s):</span> Obtain title for distribution per trust or sale. After either distribution or sale, cancel auto insurance.</span><span>10. Obtain a Market Value of Securities</span><span><span>:</span> The total value of all property in the trust will determine whether it will be necessary to file federal and state estate tax returns.</span><span><span>11. Check for Safe Deposit Box:</span> If there is a safe deposit box, it should be checked for any instructions that may have been left for actions to be taken after death. It is also important to prepare an inventory of the contents in the safe deposit box.</span><span><span>12. Bank Account(s):</span> Reregister bank accounts under new Trustee. Funds may be needed immediately to pay funeral expenses, so make sure that there is enough money available.</span><span><span>13. Check for evidence of Storage Unit(s):</span> If there are any storage units, they need to be inventoried and the items need to be appraised.</span><span><span>14. Notify Life Insurance Companies of the Death of the Insured:</span> Request the beneficiary packet, complete the paperwork and provide the necessary information to process the claim.</span><span><span>15. Promissory Note(s):</span> Collect and review copy of the note. Need to obtain payor information to contact them and inform them of new Trustee and where to send future payments.</span><span><span>16. Review Business Agreement(s):</span> Review any business agreements, contracts, stock certificates, partnership agreements, etc., to which the grantor or the trust are parties. If the trust property includes a business interest, document the value of this interest if either the estate is likely to be taxable or the business interest will be sold. To obtain this valuation, hire a qualified appraiser of business interests or a CPA experienced in business valuations.</span><span><span>17. Obtain Appraisals:</span> Get appraisals for artwork, collectibles, antiques, cars, boats, RVs, etc. Check to see if any of these items are to be distributed as a specific bequest. If not and no beneficiary wants them, liquidate.</span><span><span>18. Review Investments:</span> Ensure the current investments retained in the trust are appropriate for the income and growth objectives of the trust.</span><span><span>19. Identify and Locate Beneficiary(s):</span> If there is no contact information readily available, track down beneficiary(s) by hiring an outside service. Beneficiary(s) will</span><span>need to sign and return a W-9(s). The W-9(s) will be provided to the CPA for preparation of K-1(s).</span><span><span>20. Credit Cards:</span> Collect all cards, cancel and destroy.</span><span><span>21. Review an</span></span><span>d Pay Bills</span><span><span>:</span> Pay all permissible expenses related to the grantor. Begin making payment for trust expenses.</span><span><span>22. Distribute the Personal Effects:</span> Distribute any personal effects and household furnishings per the governing document.</span><span><span>23. Animals:</span> Need to locate, secure and follow provisions for disposition of pets.</span><span><span>24. Contact CPA:</span> Obtain past returns. If CPA is unknown, hire new CPA and request transcript of past returns from the IRS.</span><span><span>25. When a Revocable Trust Becomes Irrevocable Due to Death:</span> It will be necessary to get a new Taxpayer Identification Number from the Internal Revenue Service. Complete an IRS Form SS-4.</span><span><span>26. File Income Tax Returns and Pay Income Taxes:</span> When applicable, work with grantor’s CPA to ensure the final tax return is filed. In addition, file federal and state fiduciary income tax returns.</span><span><span>27. File Federal Estate Tax Form 706:</span> Consult with CPA and attorney to see if applicable. This form will need to be filed when the estate exceeds the applicable exclusion amount. Form 706 is also done to transfer any unused exclusion amounts to a surviving spouse.</span><span><span>28. Determine if GST Exemption is Applicable:</span> Consult with the CPA.</span><span><span>29. Distribute the Assets:</span> Following the terms of the trust document. Begin distributing assets to the beneficiary(ies).</span>&nbsp;<span>There will probably be many other tasks to be done in this post mortem administration of the trust, many of which involve legal, financial, or tax issues. Much of the various administration issues depend upon asset structure, tax issues and whether or not any litigation issues arise. </span>&nbsp;<span>To learn more send us an email at info@premiertrust.com or give us a call at 702-577-1777</span>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.premiertrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Duties-of-a-Successor-Trustee-Handout.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download the Printable Version</a></span>&nbsp;</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/65f86d71014f570b1c27f145/1713413408355-MST0NJVQH3JZR8T6OFRT/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="450"><media:title type="plain">Duties of a Successor Trustee</media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
